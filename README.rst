BuildStream Plugins
===========
A collection of plugins for the BuildStream project that are too
specific or prone to change for inclusion in the main repository.

How to use this repo
===========
At the moment, this repo is a sort of incubation repo; it contains things
which explicitly dont yet have strong API guarantees.

Therefore, for the time being we recommend use bst-external as a submodule
for your buildstream projects.
